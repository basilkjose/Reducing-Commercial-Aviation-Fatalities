## Overview
Most of the flight fatalities or flight accidents due to pilot error are due to the loss of airplane state awareness. Airplane state awareness (ASA) is a pilot performance attribute wherein the pilot should be able to realize and respond quickly to any change of state of the airplane. Loss of airplane state awareness may lead to many dangerous situations and may result in loss of airplane control. Loss of ASA is mainly due to loss of attention on the part of pilots who may be distracted, sleepy, or in other dangerous cognitive states. Due to the stressful environment, while flying, the possibility of the loss of awareness is common.So our challenge is to build a model to detect troubling events from aircrew's physiological data. For this project we used [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
